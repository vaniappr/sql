An analytical exploration of end-to-end data management with the primary purpose of presenting business insights. The company chosen for this report is Safe Space Hotels, based in the United Kingdom, which is suitable for personal and/or business trip purposes. With locations across the UK, it is beneficial for head management to monitor performance in each branch, identify loyal customers, and analyse staff performance. The following report includes database design, data implementation, synthetic data generation, SQL querying, and data visualisation techniques.

Safe Space Hotels operates multiple properties throughout the UK, offering accommodations for both leisure and business travellers. Safe Space Hotels manages several interconnected business processes across its UK locations, including employee management, property management for various room types, facility operations (gyms, pools, conference rooms, car parks, etc), and a multi-channel reservation system accepting both online and walk-in bookings. The company maintains customer profiles to track preferences, stay history, payments, and collects customer feedback. This integrated approach requires a comprehensive database that connects customer, room, facilities, booking, feedback, payment and employee data to support management decision-making and enhance the revenue as well as guest experience at each location.  

The company's success depends on efficient operations, employee performance across all locations, and customer satisfaction. To support these objectives, a robust database system is needed to track and analyse key business insights on three critical areas: 

- Branch Performance Comparison - Identify high and low-performing locations, with particular emphasis on yearly revenue across all properties.
- Employee Analysis - Location-specific employee analysis including employee profile and turnover rates.
- Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty - Systematic measurement of guest feedback to identify loyal customers and develop targeted marketing strategies.
